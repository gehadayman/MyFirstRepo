#Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Gehad Ayman. I graduated from the Faculty of Law and I'm passionate about technology and software engineering. I've been actively learning about backend development, Git, and cloud tools through the ALX program.

In my free time, I enjoy learning new skills and challenging myself through real projects. I'm working hard to become a Cloud Solutions Architect and build useful tools that can make peopleâ€™s lives easier.
